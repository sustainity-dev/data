**Note that this is only a demo of the app we want to develop. None of the features is ready to use yet.**

üåç  We are excited to have you join us on our journey towards a more sustainable future.
Our app is designed to help you make more informed choices about the products you buy,
and the impacts they have on the environment.

ü´∂  With our app, you can easily research on your consumption habits,
learn about sustainable alternatives and the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR) of companies,
and connect with local producers to support local businesses.

‚úÖ  We are committed to providing you with information needed to make responsible consumer decisions
all in one place, and helping you make a positive impact on the world.

# What are we going to do?

In the first phase of this project we are aggregating all publicly available information about
  
 - sustainabilty of products
 - level of corporate social responsibility of companies

to have all of the information needed to make responsible consumer decisions in one place.

The data we need to collect is very fragmented and incomplete, which makes this task very challenging.
Once the project gains momentum and more of your support,
we are going to start to actively ask companies and cerifying organisations
to start proving us more detailed information in more structured way.
We are committed to making all our data open to everyone and we open the source of all our software.
We hope to get many companies on board with those ideals
to create together a distributed database of verified products and services
to achieve more open, more transparent and more circular economy for everyone. ü§ù

# Features

Making sure you make the best consumer decisions and staying up to date with the latest news is a full-time job.
Nobody has time for that.
That's why we need an easy way to asses sustainability of all the products and services available in the market.

With this app we aim to solve this problem. These are the features we plan to implement:

üîç  product or company search (by name or barcode) -
find available information, potential impacts and possible alternatives

üåê  map search -
look for eco-friendly shops, (truelly) vegan restaurans, local food producers etc. in some area

Feel free to propose more features!
