# Data sources

Open Food Facts provide their data exports in various formats
[in their website](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data).

# How we use their data

Open Food Facts is probably the best openly available source of data about products (mainly food)
containing their barcodes (for easy identification), pictures, producers, brands, categories, etc.

We try to match the companies from Open Food Facts to companies from Wikidata,
but since all we have is just the name, that's not a reliable method.
Due to amount it the data we cannot match Open Food Facts products to the Wikidata products,
so we simply copy them to our database.
