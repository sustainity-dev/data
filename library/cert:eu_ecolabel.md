# Description
  
The EU Ecolabel is a voluntary scheme promoting goods and services that demonstrate environmental excellence, based on standardized criteria. Any products that have been awarded the EU Ecolabel meet a set of high environmental and performance standards.

Here are three key points to know about the EU Ecolabel:
 - It is a world-renowned, multi-criteria ecolabel that tackles the main environmental impacts of products along their full lifecycle.
 - It is third-party verified, which means independent experts are responsible for checking compliance with the EU Ecolabel criteria.
 - It encourages higher environmental performance in all sectors and supports products and services that have a lower environmental impact and contribute to sustainable development along their life cycle.
