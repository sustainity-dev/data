# Description

The Fashion Transparency Index is a tool created by Fashion Revolution to incentivize the world's largest fashion brands to be more transparent about their social and environmental efforts. The Index comprises 246 indicators covering a wide range of social and environmental topics such as animal welfare, biodiversity, climate, due diligence, forced labor, freedom of association, gender equality, hazardous chemicals, living wages, purchasing practices, supplier disclosure, waste and recycling, and working conditions. Here are three key points to know about the Fashion Transparency Index:

- It uses a ratings methodology, which benchmarks companies' publicly facing information against basic best practice in supply chain transparency.
- The Index reviews 250 brands with an annual turnover of at least $400 million on the information they publicly disclose about sustainability, across 246 categories.
- The Index is one tool that Fashion Revolution has developed to help bring about systemic change in the industry, and it encourages brands to disclose more information about their policies, practices, and impacts.
