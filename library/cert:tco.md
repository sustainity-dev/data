# Description
  
TCO Certified is a sustainability certification for IT products that includes a comprehensive system of up-to-date criteria, independent verification, and a structured system for continuous improvement to drive real and lasting change. Here are three key points to know about TCO Certified:
- TCO Certified is the world's leading sustainability certification for IT products, designed to drive social and environmental responsibility in the IT industry.
- It includes comprehensive environmental and social criteria with direct impact, and a structured system for continuous improvements that guides the industry to more sustainable ways of working.
- TCO Certified is a third-party certification independent of the IT industry and buyers, and it meets the requirements of ISO 14024 Ecolabel Type 1 and has been approved by the Global Ecolabelling Network.

# Data sources

Products certified by TCO can be browsed in their [Product Finder](https://tcocertified.com/product-finder/).
Unfortunately part of the data requires payed access.

Unfortunately we were not able to find their data in machine-readable format anywhere on their webpage.

# How we use their data
  
TCO certifies individual products.
Unfortunately in the data they provide, there is no entry that would allow us to reliably connect those entry to more broad databases like Wiki Data.

To use the TCO data to the full extent, we should either

 - manually go through all the entries and try to match them with products (and possibly publish those it in Wiki Data), or

 - ask TCO to improve their data quality by suplementing it with data that could help us more reliably identify the products (e.g. product ID, links to official product websites, etc.)

Due to time constraints, so far we only gathered all certified companies and mark all products of those companies, so our "TCO badge" means "at least one product of this company was certified".
